# DAT an architecture description and associated modeling platform for the model-driven engineering of Data Architecture for IoT. 
Data Architecture deals with describing data flow from source to destination. 
DAT give you the ability to describe (HLA) high-level Architecture and (LLA) Low Level Architecture. 
This data view is considered the fourth view for the CAPS (http://caps.disim.univaq.it/) framework . 
The DAT was able to model data pipelines, Data warehouses (verified by Amazon), and big data architectures like Lambda.
