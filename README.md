# DAT an architecture description and associated modeling platform for the model-driven engineering of Data Architecture for IoT. 
Data Architecture deals with describing data flow from source to destination. 
DAT allows you to describe (HLA) high-level Architecture and (LLA) Low-Level Architecture. 
This data view is considered the fourth for the CAPS (http://caps.disim.univaq.it/) framework. 
The DAT could model data pipelines, Data warehouses (verified by Amazon), and big data architectures like Lambda.
